## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(tidyverse)

mydata <- as_tibble(read.csv(file = "data.csv")) %>%
  select(-data.file.path) %>%
  group_by(step_sz, build_type) %>%
  summarize(duration_us_mean = mean(duration_us), duration_us_sd = sd(duration_us), count = n())

ggplot(mydata) %+%
  geom_line(aes(x = step_sz, y = duration_us_mean, color = build_type))
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
